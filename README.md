---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **To Use:**
Your Anki deck must contain fields named:

- **`Word`**
- **`Sentence`**
- **`Audio`**

You can choose to generate text-to-speech audio from either:

- **`Sentence`**
- **`Word`**

### **Important:**
You must specify the location of your Anki's `collection.media` folder (audio files must be uploaded to this folder to function). This can be accessed via:

**Tools > Check Media**

Manually added files should be checked here to ensure proper syncing.

### **Deck Specification:**
You must specify the DECK you're using the program for.
